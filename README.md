ciox_exa
========

A prototype for edge computing having below features:

- collecting data from several nodes,
- processing collected data,
- submitting processed data to a server.
- using redis for storing mediate data.
- each process is configurable.
- each process is independent so that it can be replacable anytime.
- each process can be scale out.  It can be placed out of IOx.

See README-ja.md written in Japanese.
